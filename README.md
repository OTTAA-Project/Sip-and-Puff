The Sip & Puff switch is a device which is activated by sipping and puffing, simulating the functions of “left and right-click”. When the user puffs or blows, the left-click function is activated, on the other side, when the user sips or inhales the right-click function is activated. The device is compatible with Android, Windows, MacOS and Linux. It also allows the selection of items with the screen scanning functionality of OTTAA Project.
